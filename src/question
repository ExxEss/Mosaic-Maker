I've read some articles with the same topic before, is too boring
to extract all views made by Paul Graham, he is a famous programmer,
some bible-like books are written by him, but i never have read one,
maybe i will do that later.

Paul is a well-known lisper, he've gained much more fame than any
PL designer, but he's a user more than a designer, so i will consider
all his sayings as "personal feelings and taste".

C was invented for Unix, lisp for AI, Fortran for science computing,
SmallTalk for GUI, Java for multi-platform, they are all great PL,
they are all invented for resolving some tough and concrete problems,
even they have changed a lot as time passed by, but they are still
maintaining their superiority for the problems which they were designed for,
none of they were created for designing experiments but real world
requirements.

We should ask ourselves how badly we hate to use these existing programming
languages to resolve some problems before taking it seriously to design
a new one for them, because only huge hared could make some significant
changes for our programmers LOL

Creating a new programming language like to have a baby, it won't grow well
if even it's creator doesn't really love it.

All the successful programming languages are evolving all the time,
at very first it is raised by it's own father(รณ mother), since then,
more and more programmer dedicate to improve it, getting more and more
sophisticated.
